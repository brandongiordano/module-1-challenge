# module-1-challenge
The Module 1 Challenge.
This project required the class to refactor code for a make-believe marketing agency website called Horiseon Social Solution Services, Incorporated. Most of the code for the project was given but we were required to make the links functional, making the semantic HTML elements more legible, and providing alt descriptions for the images.

Here is a preview image of the webpage: <img src="module-1-challenge-repo\Assets\01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png" alt="Preview of Horseon Webpage"
